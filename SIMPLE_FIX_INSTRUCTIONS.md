# ✅ SIMPLE FIX: Get Club Names Showing

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM
Your events have club_id values (1, 61) that don't exist in the database.
That's why the club names show as blank!

## 🚀 THE EASIEST FIX

### Option 1: Use SQL*Plus (Automatic Fix)
```bash
sqlplus system/password@localhost:1521/free @auto-fix-club-names.sql
```

This will automatically:
1. Find the first valid club in your database
2. Update ALL events to use that club
3. Show you the results

### Option 2: Manual Fix in UI (Simplest)
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/events
2. **Delete all old events** (click Delete on each one)
3. **Create a NEW event** using the club dropdown
4. The new event will show the club name correctly!

## 📊 What the Debug Showed

```
Transformed event: { title: 'test7', club_id: 61, club_name: null }
Transformed event: { title: 'test8', club_id: 1, club_name: null }
```

**Translation:**
- Event "test7" is trying to use club ID 61 → That club doesn't exist → Shows nothing
- Event "test8" is trying to use club ID 1 → That club doesn't exist → Shows nothing

## ✅ WHICH FIX SHOULD YOU USE?

**If you want to keep your events:**
- Run the SQL script: `auto-fix-club-names.sql`

**If you don't mind starting fresh:**
- Just delete all events and create new ones

## 🔍 After the Fix
