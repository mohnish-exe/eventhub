# 🔧 REMAINING ISSUES - CURRENT STATUS

## Issue 1: Overlap Detection Still Returning `count: 0` ❌

### 📊 Current Status:
**PARTIALLY FIXED** - Code is correct but may need database testing

### What Was Fixed:
✅ Changed ALL time comparisons to use `TO_TIMESTAMP` for proper comparison  
✅ Fixed `/api/classrooms/available` endpoint (lines 204-221)  
✅ Fixed classroom bookings overlap check (lines 453-464)  
✅ Fixed events overlap check (lines 483-504)  

### Why It Might Still Fail:
The terminal output shows:
```
Event overlap check result: { count: 0, rows: [ { CNT: 0 } ] }
```

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Events were deleted** - The test events you created might have been deleted
2. **Times stored differently** - The database might have times in a different format
3. **Date mismatch** - The event might be on a different date than expected

### 🧪 How to Test:
1. Go to Events page
2. Create an event: **Oct 30, 2025 | 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM | Room 505**
3. Try to create another: **Oct 30, 2025 | 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM | Room 505**
4. **Expected**: Room 505 should NOT appear in venue dropdown
5. Check backend terminal for:
   ```
   Existing events at this venue/date: [ { EVENT_ID: '...', START_TIME: '17:00', END_TIME: '19:00' } ]
   Event overlap check result: { count: 1, ... }
   ```

### 🔍 Debug Query Added:
The backend now logs:
- **Existing events** at the venue/date
- **Overlap count** result
- **Query parameters** being used

**If `count: 0` when events exist**, the issue is:
- ❌ Times are stored in a different format than expected
- ❌ The `TO_TIMESTAMP` conversion is failing

**Next Step if Still Broken:**
- Check what format times are ACTUALLY stored in the database
- Run the `test-overlap-fix.sql` script to see raw database data

## Issue 2: Club Name Not Showing on Event Cards ❓

### 📊 Current Status:
**INVESTIGATING** - Need to see actual API response

### What's Confirmed Working:
✅ SQL queries include `LEFT JOIN CLUBS_1` with `cl.name as club_name`  
✅ Backend transformation maps `CLUB_NAME` to `club_name` (line 350)  
✅ Frontend EventCard displays `event.club_name || event.clubs?.name` (line 119)  
✅ Debug logging added to see raw data  

### 🧪 What to Check:

#### Backend Terminal:
When you refresh the Events page, you should see:
```
Raw event data sample: {
  CLUB_ID: 1,
  CLUB_NAME: 'Tech Club',
  TITLE: 'My Event'
}
```

**If CLUB_NAME is `undefined` or `null`:**
- The events don't have `club_id` set in the database
- Likely created before the club dropdown was implemented

#### Browser DevTools (Network Tab):
Check the response from `/api/events`:
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "title": "My Event",
  "club_id": 1,
  "club_name": "Tech Club",  // <-- Should be here
  ...
}
```

**If `club_name` is in the response but not showing on the card:**
- Frontend rendering issue
- Possible null/undefined handling problem

**If `club_name` is missing from the response:**
- Backend transformation issue
- Need to check the mapping logic

### 🎯 Most Likely Cause:
**Old events created before club dropdown** don't have `club_id` set.

**Solution:**
1. Create a **NEW event** using the club dropdown
2. Check if the NEW event shows the club name
3. If yes → Old events need to be recreated or manually updated in database
4. If no → Deeper backend/frontend issue

## 📋 WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

### For Overlap Issue:
1. Try creating a duplicate event (same venue, date, time)
2. Tell me:
   - Does Room 505 appear in the dropdown when it shouldn't?
   - What does the backend terminal show for "Existing events" and "Event overlap check result"?

### For Club Name Issue:
1. Open Browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
2. Refresh Events page
3. Click on the `/api/events` request
4. Look at the Response tab
5. Tell me:
   - Is `club_name` present in the JSON?
   - What value does it have? (`null`, `undefined`, or an actual name?)
   - What does the backend terminal show for "Raw event data sample"?

---

## 🚀 TEMPORARY WORKAROUND

### If Club Names Don't Show:
1. Delete all existing events
2. Create NEW events using the club dropdown
3. The new events should show club names

### If Overlap Detection Fails:
1. The venue dropdown might still show booked venues
2. But the backend SHOULD still reject the event creation with error message
3. Trust the error message, not the dropdown for now
