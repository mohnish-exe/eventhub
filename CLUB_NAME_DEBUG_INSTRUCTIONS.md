# 🔍 CLUB NAME NOT SHOWING - DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS

## 📊 WHAT I'VE DONE

### Backend Changes:
1. ✅ Added debug logging to `/api/events` endpoint
2. ✅ Verified SQL queries include `LEFT JOIN CLUBS_1 cl ON e.club_id = cl.id`
3. ✅ Verified backend is transforming `CLUB_NAME` correctly

### Frontend:
✅ `EventCard.tsx` line 119 displays: `event.club_name || event.clubs?.name`

---

## 🧪 HOW TO DEBUG

### Step 1: Refresh Browser
1. Go to http://localhost:8080
2. Navigate to **Events** page
3. Look at the event cards

### Step 2: Check Terminal Output
Look at the backend PowerShell window for this debug log:
```
Raw event data sample: {
  CLUB_ID: <number>,
  CLUB_NAME: '<club name>' or null,
  TITLE: '<event title>'
}
```

### Step 3: Check Browser DevTools
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Refresh the Events page
4. Find the request to `/api/events`
5. Click on it and check the **Response** tab
6. Look for the `club_name` field in the JSON response

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS

### If club_name is in the response:
✅ The issue is in the frontend rendering
❌ If not showing, it's a styling/component issue

### If club_name is NULL in the response:
❌ The issue is that events don't have `club_id` set
🔧 Need to check database records

### If club_name is missing from the response:
❌ Backend transformation issue
🔧 Need to fix the backend code

## 🔍 POSSIBLE CAUSES

### 1. Events Created Before Club Dropdown
**Symptom**: Old events don't have `club_id` set
**Solution**: These events will show blank for "Organized by"
**Fix**: Delete old events and create new ones with club selected

### 2. Database Connection Issue
**Symptom**: LEFT JOIN not working
**Solution**: Check if CLUBS_1 table has data
**Fix**: Run query to verify clubs exist

### 3. Frontend Not Receiving Data
**Symptom**: Network response shows club_name but UI doesn't
**Solution**: React state issue or rendering problem
**Fix**: Check browser console for errors

## 📝 WHAT TO TELL ME

Please provide:

1. **Backend Terminal Output**:
   ```
   Raw event data sample: { CLUB_ID: ?, CLUB_NAME: ?, TITLE: ? }
   ```

2. **Browser Network Response** (from DevTools):
   ```json
   {
     "id": "...",
     "title": "...",
     "club_id": ?,
     "club_name": "...",
     ...
   }
   ```

3. **What you see on the event card**:
   - Does it say "Organized by" with nothing after it?
   - Does it say "Organized by null" or "Organized by undefined"?
   - Is the line missing entirely?

## 🚀 QUICK FIX TO TRY

If the club_name is coming through but not displaying, try this:

1. Create a **NEW event** using the club dropdown
2. Check if the NEW event shows the club name
3. If yes, then old events just need to be recreated
4. If no, then there's a deeper issue
