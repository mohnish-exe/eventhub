## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
All data pulled from Oracle database via OracleServices:
- `Events.getAll()`
- `Clubs.getAll()`
- `Classrooms.getAll()`
- `ClassroomBookings.getAll()`

### Calculations
1. **Upcoming Events**: Filter events where `event_date >= today`
2. **Active Today**: Filter events where `event_date === today`
3. **This Month**: Filter events between `startOfMonth` and `endOfMonth`
4. **Utilization**: `(total_bookings / (total_classrooms × 30_days)) × 100`
5. **Monthly Trends**: Group events by month for last 6 months using `date-fns`
6. **Top Clubs**: Map and count events by `club_id`, sort by count
7. **Top Venues**: Map and count events by venue, sort by bookings
8. **Recent Events**: Sort all events by date descending, take first 10

### Libraries Used
- `date-fns`: Date manipulation and formatting
  - `format`, `parseISO`, `startOfMonth`, `endOfMonth`
  - `eachMonthOfInterval`, `subMonths`
- `lucide-react`: Icons
  - `Calendar`, `Users`, `Building2`, `TrendingUp`
  - `Activity`, `Clock`, `MapPin`, `Award`

## 🎨 Design Features

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Gradient Cards**: Each metric card has unique color-coded gradients
2. **Icon Backgrounds**: Rounded containers with semi-transparent backgrounds
3. **Hover Effects**: Charts show tooltips on hover
4. **Responsive Grid**: Adapts from 1 to 4 columns based on screen size
5. **Consistent Spacing**: `space-y-8` for main sections, `space-y-4` for lists

### Color Scheme
- **Blue**: Events (primary metric)
- **Purple**: Active/current activity
- **Green**: Bookings (positive action)
- **Orange**: Utilization (warning/attention)

### Typography
- **Large Numbers**: `text-3xl font-bold` for main metrics
- **Small Labels**: `text-xs text-muted-foreground` for descriptions
- **Medium Text**: `text-sm font-medium` for list items
