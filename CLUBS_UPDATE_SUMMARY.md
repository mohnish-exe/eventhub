- Added a "Delete Club" button below the "View Events" button on each club card
- Button features:
  - Red destructive variant for visual emphasis
  - Trash icon for clarity
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Full-width button layout

### 2. **Created Club Events Sub-Page** ✅
- When "View Events" is clicked, users are taken to a new sub-page
- Features:
  - Page title: "Events by {Club Name}"
  - Displays only events organized by the selected club
  - Events are filtered by `club_id`
  - Uses the same `EventCard` component from the Events page
  - Supports event deletion from this view

### 3. **Added "View Clubs" Back Button** ✅
- Back button features:
  - Positioned at the top of the club events sub-page
  - Left arrow icon for visual clarity
  - Returns user to the main clubs list
  - Clears selected club state

### 4. **Made All Club Fields Mandatory** ✅
- All fields in the "Add Club" dialog are now required:
  - Club Name * (was already required)
  - Description * (newly required)
  - Coordinator Email * (newly required)
  - Coordinator Contact * (newly required)
- Added helpful placeholder text to each field
- HTML5 form validation ensures all fields are filled

### 5. **Database Schema Updates** ✅
- Created migration script: `supabase/migrations/20251021_make_clubs_fields_mandatory.sql`
- Updates:
  - `description` column: Changed from `CLOB` to `CLOB NOT NULL`
  - `coordinator_email` column: Changed from `VARCHAR2(255)` to `VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL`
  - `coordinator_contact` column: Changed from `VARCHAR2(20)` to `VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL`
- Migration handles existing NULL values by providing defaults before applying constraints
- Updated base schema file (`oracle-schema.sql`) for future reference

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Changes

#### `src/pages/Clubs.tsx`
- **New State Variables:**
  - `selectedClub`: Tracks which club's events are being viewed
  - `clubEvents`: Stores filtered events for the selected club
  - `loadingEvents`: Loading state for fetching club events

- **New Functions:**
  - `loadClubEvents(clubId, clubName)`: Fetches and filters events by club
  - `handleDeleteClub(clubId, clubName)`: Deletes a club with confirmation
  - `handleDeleteEvent(eventId)`: Deletes an event from club events view
  - `handleBackToClubs()`: Returns to main clubs list

- **Conditional Rendering:**
  - Shows club events sub-page when `selectedClub` is set
  - Shows main clubs list otherwise

#### `supabase/migrations/20251021_make_clubs_fields_mandatory.sql`
- Safely updates existing NULL values to prevent constraint violations
- Alters table to add NOT NULL constraints
- Commits changes to database

#### `oracle-schema.sql`
- Updated clubs table definition to reflect NOT NULL constraints
- Ensures future database setups have correct schema

## How to Apply Database Changes

To apply the database migration:

```sql
-- Run this SQL script in your Oracle database
@supabase/migrations/20251021_make_clubs_fields_mandatory.sql
```

Or execute the SQL commands manually:

```sql
-- Update existing NULL values
UPDATE clubs_1 SET description = 'No description provided' WHERE description IS NULL;
UPDATE clubs_1 SET coordinator_email = 'no-email@example.com' WHERE coordinator_email IS NULL;
UPDATE clubs_1 SET coordinator_contact = '0000000000' WHERE coordinator_contact IS NULL;

-- Add NOT NULL constraints
ALTER TABLE clubs_1 MODIFY (description CLOB NOT NULL);
ALTER TABLE clubs_1 MODIFY (coordinator_email VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL);
ALTER TABLE clubs_1 MODIFY (coordinator_contact VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL);

COMMIT;
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Delete button uses destructive variant (red) to indicate dangerous action
2. **Confirmation Dialogs**: All delete operations require user confirmation
3. **Intuitive Navigation**: Back button with arrow icon makes it easy to return to clubs list
4. **Data Integrity**: Required fields ensure all clubs have complete information
5. **Helpful Placeholders**: Input fields show examples to guide users
6. **Responsive Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm successful operations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new club with all required fields
- [ ] Attempt to create a club without filling all fields (should fail)
- [ ] View events for a club that has events
- [ ] View events for a club with no events
- [ ] Delete an event from the club events view
- [ ] Navigate back to clubs list using "View Clubs" button
- [ ] Delete a club (with confirmation)
- [ ] Verify database has NOT NULL constraints on club fields
