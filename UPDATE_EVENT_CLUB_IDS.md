# üîß FIX: Club Names Not Showing

## üéØ THE PROBLEM

From the debug logs, I can see:
```
Transformed event: { title: 'test7', club_id: 61, club_name: null }
Transformed event: { title: 'test8', club_id: 1, club_name: null }
Transformed event: { title: 'asdfg', club_id: 61, club_name: null }
```

**What this means:**
- Events have `club_id` = 1 or 61
- But when the database does `LEFT JOIN CLUBS_1 cl ON e.CLUB_ID = cl.ID`, it returns `null`
- This can only happen if **clubs with ID 1 and 61 don't exist** in the CLUBS_1 table

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Update Events to Use Existing Clubs (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Check which clubs exist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ID, NAME FROM CLUBS_1 ORDER BY ID;
   ```

2. **Update events to use a valid club_id:**
   ```sql
   -- Example: If club ID 1 exists, update all events with null/invalid clubs
   UPDATE EVENTS_1 
   SET CLUB_ID = 1 
   WHERE CLUB_ID IN (61) OR CLUB_ID IS NULL;
   
   COMMIT;
   ```

### Option 2: Create Missing Clubs

If you need clubs with ID 1 and 61:
```sql
-- Create club with ID 1
INSERT INTO CLUBS_1 (ID, NAME, DESCRIPTION, COORDINATOR_EMAIL, COORDINATOR_CONTACT)
VALUES (1, 'Default Club', 'Default club for events', 'club@example.com', '1234567890');

-- Create club with ID 61
INSERT INTO CLUBS_1 (ID, NAME, DESCRIPTION, COORDINATOR_EMAIL, COORDINATOR_CONTACT)
VALUES (61, 'Tech Club', 'Technology club', 'tech@example.com', '1234567890');

COMMIT;
```

### Option 3: Delete Old Events and Create New Ones (EASIEST)

1. Delete all existing events
2. Create new events using the club dropdown
3. The new events will have valid club_ids

---

## üöÄ QUICK FIX (DO THIS NOW)

**Step 1:** Check existing clubs in your database:
```sql
SELECT ID, NAME FROM CLUBS_1;
```

**Step 2:** Pick ONE of these options:

### A) Update all events to use the first valid club:
```sql
-- Get the ID of the first club
SELECT ID, NAME FROM CLUBS_1 WHERE ROWNUM = 1;

-- Update all events (replace :club_id with actual ID from above)
UPDATE EVENTS_1 SET CLUB_ID = :club_id WHERE CLUB_ID IS NULL OR CLUB_ID NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM CLUBS_1);
COMMIT;
```

### B) Just delete all events and start fresh:
```sql
DELETE FROM EVENTS_1;
COMMIT;
```

## üìã WHAT TO DO NEXT

1. **Run one of the SQL fixes above** in your Oracle database
2. **Refresh the Events page** in your browser
3. **The club names should now appear!**

Or simply:
1. **Delete all existing events** from the UI
2. **Create a new event** using the club dropdown
3. **The new event will show the club name correctly**

---

## üîç WHY THIS HAPPENED

- Old events were created with `club_id` values that don't exist
- Some events were created before the club dropdown feature
- Some events were created with hardcoded `club_id` values during testing

The database is working correctly - it just doesn't have clubs with those IDs!
